\begin{abstract}

In this paper, we present our research on detecting habitual reading region 
on the screen when a user is doing his daily online reading. Instead of traditional eye-tracking based solution,
we developed an unintrusive user attention tracking(UUAT) solution. In UUAT, we developed a ReadingClue 
technology,  which helps to pinpoint user reading attention when necessary. At the same time, user reading behavioral data(mouse click and mouse scroll) is
collected in background. With these behavioral data, UUAT calculates a user's preferred reading range. Our experiment
indicates that the accuracy of UUAT attention tracking is as high as 93.2\%.

\section{Introduction}

Personal Data Mining[1](PDM) has been proposed as a complement to commercial/business data mining, which aims to get useful knowledge to improve business opportunity or products popularity. Unlike the concept of commercial data mining, PDM is proposed for a user’s individual good. In PDM, user behavioral data is collected by a neutral utility. The user can choose third-party tools(local) or service(cloud) to analyze his personal data, aiming to improve individual productivity or quality of life.

 
	As the first step of PDM, Self-Tracking[2] was proposed to log personal data, so that future analysis can be conducted for a user’s good in health. Self-Tracking has been mainly involved in personal physical data, such as, weight, heartbeat, diet and sports. Moreover, the way of logging data has been mainly referred to manual logging, e.g. a user input his weight before going to bed everyday. In this paper, we argue that the reign of personal data is more than physical data and the ways to collect personal data can be extended to an automatic and stealthy way. 


In this research, we consider a user’s daily reading as a source of personal data. An immediate reason is that to understand a user’s daily reading helps to build a user’s personal knowledge demography, let alone “For many self-trackers, the goal is unknown”[3]. We do not consider what a user have read as static data, instead, we consider it as dynamic. For example, if a user spend more unit reading time on  paragraph 1 than average, this might indicate that the user might have pondered on the information in paragraph 1 or have reading struggles on paragraph 1. In either case, it might indicate that the user has encountered new knowledge and he takes time to digest this new information. From this point of view, it might be a mileage for personal knowledge acquisition, e.g., today is the day I first come to know the concept of “shale gas”, although I have read the same phrase years ago. To log this type of personal data, it is unlikely to adopt the same user-aware way, a more intelligent and stealthy method is required to obtain personal reading data. 

In this research, we focus on how to collect objective and detailed reading behavioral data, so that the PDM can be conducted on an accurate and correct basis. To be specific, we focus on a user’s daily online reading activity, our goal is to accurately identify what texts a users read that day and to what extent he spent on specific parts of an article. To realize this goal, we developed a browser-based solution to obtain a user’s preferred reading scope on a screen, by analyzing the user’s mouse/keyboard input, we provide details on user’s dwell time on each information piece(currently our granularity is paragraph-based). By doing this, we enable a more extensive PDM applications which we will discuss in future work of this paper. Our contributions are as follows: 1.We developed an almost UnIntrusive User Attention Tracking utility, which helps to get a user’s preferred reading scope in a stealthy way. 2. We developed  a solution to get a users daily reading data which can be used as input for deep personal data mining. 


\section{Related Work}

The idea of quantified self-tracking is well known proposed in [3]. In [3], the author advocates collecting individual quantified data. He presents cases where individual data collection helped to solve person-specific problems. For example, Barbier used her personal data to find a way to cure her insomnia[3],  Seth Roberts, a Caltech professor, analyzed his personal data and find an optimum diet(flaxseed oil) to improve his math performance[3]. In this paper, the author advocates a diversified personal data collection, as long as the data is quantified, albeit you might not know the goal of your data collection immediately. 


Since the current personal data mainly includes personal physical data, such as weight, glucose, heartbeat, sports, food/medication consumption. The pervasive methods of personal data collection are mainly by a user himself, such as the methods adopted by PatientsLikeMe[4]. 


	Our proposed research is very similar to the work in the field of computer human interaction(HCI). To get a user’s preferred reading scope on a screen, there are mainly two categories of solutions, method of eye-track based and method of user input tracking.  
Although having the advantages of highly goal-revealing and providing more details, eye-tracking[5] methods are also tagged as intrusive and expensive. It is impractical to popularize an eye-tracking based application to a large scale, in fact, the eye-tracking method are mainly applied in the software usability test. 


Compared to eye-tracking method, our proposed research is closer to the method of user input tracking[6,7,8,9,10].  The authors of [6] collected user mouse data, at the same time they collected user’s eye gaze data, they proved that the user mouse data can indicate user behavior, e.g. which part of the screen is more attractive, the user distraction behavior can be detected and the user experience can be predicted by mouse analysis in an accuracy of 80%. The result of this research is highly depend on the eye-gaze data and we argue that the user behavior might be changed once a subject is put into a headset device and knowing he might be taped in a video. The research of [9] are conducted in a goal of software usability test. They collect user data in an implicit(stealthy) way, which is more objective. The collected data is very detail focused, which might be used to construct a “playback” for a tester’s tryout. The downside of this research is that it needs to log every interaction between a user and a web component(not a web page, but each HTML components in that webpage),  e.g. how long does it take the tester to first click on a specific radio button on a page. This makes it a difficult knowledge in the context of web2.0. So a further research[10] is conducted on how to log user interaction with Ajax-based web components. Since the research goal is to evaluate a software usability, the work in [9,10] collects data in a raw and  particular way. Furthermore, extra server-side support is needed to conduct the data collection, making it less scalable. The research of [7,8] are conducted for evaluation of search engine result pages. Both of them collect data for the goal to discover which search engine result item is more attractive to a user. In [7], the author proposed a “viewport” technology, which blurs all the other result items except one item, so that the user can put his attention on result item. In this way, the user is forced to locate his reading range to where the unblurred item is.  In [8], the author also tries to make use of mouse data, but they are more interested in the mouse trajectory instead of the mouse click, since the mouse is more often to move in the screen than a mouse is clicked, but the mouse move does not always trigger an event that can be logged. With the comparison of eye-gaze data, they disclose that the mouse trajectory can be used to infer a user’s interest on the search engine result items. 
By literature review we distinguish our research from existing works as follows: the data collection in our research is designed to be more scalable, so our data collection method can be tagged as "unintrusive", unlike the eye-gaze technology adopted in [6,8]. Meanwhile our goal is personal data collection instead of usability test, we proposed a new CHI technology to accurately infer user’s preferred reading range on the screen, so that we can collect high quality data that can describe a user’s daily reading behavior objectively. 


\section{Assumptions and Models}
The previous research on user attention tracking \cite{buscher2010eye} have disclosed some facts when a user is doing daily reading on 
 articles or document papers. Vertically, in most of the time, the reading progresses towards the end of the screen  in a line-by-line manner. 
However, the reading does not start from the first line on the screen until the last line of the screen. Generally, a user has a preferred reading region on screen,
as indicated in figure \ref{fig:read_region}. A preferred reading region can be identified by two parameters $\Delta$ and $w$. $\Delta$  indicates the 
offset from the head of the screen and $w$ indicates the vertical width of the whole region. If a user wants to read the contents outside the region,
a scroll action is expected. In this research, we take aforementioned assumption and model the user attention range as displayed in figure \ref{fig:read_region}. 



\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{preferred_reigon}
\caption{The preferred reading region on the screen}
\label{fig:read_region}
\end{figure}



Taking this model into consideration, our next  research question is: 
What behavioral data should be collected and analyzed?


Eye tracking data can be easily mentioned to answer the question, especially when a "visual" reading range is 
the goal. However, we argue that the eye tracking data has twofold major drawbacks: 1. The eye tracking collection 
requires extra hardware, which means the eye tracking  based solution  is not scalable and very costly. 2. What is even worse, 
eye tracking is "intrusive". A subject person is aware that he is wearing a headset device and he is under a camera coverage, 
his behavior is very likely to be different from how he behaves when he is doing reading alone. For these two reasons, we 
can not use eye tracking data. To meet the requirement of unintrusive but objective, the only option left is the user interaction data 
collected when the reading is ongoing. To be specific, a mouse click indicates user's reading attention at that time instant, a page scroll indicates
how much contents has been moved out of reading region. In the next section we will discuss how to 
collect and analyze user interaction data. 




\section {UUAT: Unintrusive User Attention Tracking System}

\subsection{System }

\subsection{Case Study: A User Reading Event}
In this subsection, we discuss a typical online reading event, during which a user finishes reading of a whole article. Here we suppose 
that the article is relatively lone, which requires many scroll action. The Whole reading process can be illustrated by figure 


%\begin{figure}[!h]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{pictures/scroll}
%\caption{Reading of a long article in a browser}
%\label{fig:scroll}
%\end{figure}










\subsection{Title and Authors}

Your paper's title, authors and affiliations should run across the
full width of the page in a single column 17.8 cm (7 in.) wide.  The
title should be in Helvetica 18-point bold; use Arial if Helvetica is
not available.  Authors' names should be in Times Roman 12-point bold,
and affiliations in Times Roman 12-point.  For more than three authors,
you may have to place some address information in a footnote, or in a named
section at the end of your paper. Please use full international addresses and
telephone dialing prefixes.  Leave one 10-pt line of white space below the last
line of affiliations.

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of keywords. The abstract and keywords should be
placed in the left column of the first page under the left half of the
title. The abstract should be a concise statement of the problem,
approach and conclusions of the work described.  It should clearly
state the paper's contribution to the field of HCI.

The first set of keywords will be used to index the paper in the
proceedings. The second set are used to catalogue the paper in the ACM
Digital Library. The latter are entries from the ACM Classification
System~\cite{acm_categories}.  In general, it should only be necessary
to pick one or more of the H5 subcategories, see
\url{http://www.acm.org/class/1998/ccs98.html}

\subsection{Normal or Body Text}

Please use a 10-point Times Roman font or, if this is unavailable,
another proportional font with serifs, as close as possible in
appearance to Times Roman 10-point. The Press 10-point font available
to users of Script is a good substitute for Times Roman. If Times
Roman is not available, try the font named Computer Modern Roman. On a
Macintosh, use the font named Times and not Times New Roman. Please
use sans-serif or non-proportional fonts only for special purposes,
such as headings or source code text.

\subsection{First Page Copyright Notice}

Leave 3 cm (1.25 in.) of blank space for the copyright notice at the
bottom of the left column of the first page. In this template a
floating text box will automatically generate the required space. Note
however that the text box is anchored to the \textbf{ABSTRACT}
heading, so if that heading is deleted the text box will disappear as
well.  You can replace the default copyright notice by uncommenting
the {\textbackslash}toappear block at the beginning of the document
and inserting your own text, for example, for versions under review.


\subsection{Subsequent Pages}

On pages beyond the first, start at the top of the page and continue
in double-column format.  The two columns on the last page should be
of equal length.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}

\subsection{References and Citations}

Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered
alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets
\cite{ethics,
  Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378,
  Mather:2000:MUT,
  Zellweger:2001:FAO:504216.504224}. For
papers from conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and
an abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003
proceedings, use \textit{Proc. Interact 2003}). Do not include the
location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page
numbers if available. See the examples of citations at the end of this
document. Within this template file, use the \texttt{References} style
for the text of your citation.

Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public.  Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the
report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a
nominal fee.  Proprietary information may not be cited. Private
communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced
(e.g., ``[Robertson, personal communication]'').

\end{table}

\section{Sections}

The heading of a section should be in Helvetica 9-point bold, all in
capitals. Use Arial if Helvetica is not available. Sections should
not be numbered.

\subsection{Subsections}

Headings of subsections should be in Helvetica 9-point bold with
initial letters capitalized.  For
sub-sections and sub-subsections, a word like \emph{the} or \emph{of}
is not capitalized unless it is the first word of the heading.)

\subsubsection{Sub-subsections}

Headings for sub-subsections should be in Helvetica 9-point italic
with initial letters capitalized.  Standard {\textbackslash}section,
{\textbackslash}subsection, and {\textbackslash}subsubsection commands
will work fine.

\section{Figures/Captions}

Place figures and tables at the top or bottom of the appropriate
column or columns, on the same page as the relevant text
(see Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}). A figure or table may extend across both
columns to a maximum width of 17.78 cm (7 in.).

Captions should be Times New Roman 9-point bold.  They should be numbered (e.g.,
``Table~\ref{tab:table1}'' or ``Figure~\ref{fig:figure2}''), centered
and placed beneath the figure or table.  Please note that the words
``Figure'' and ``Table'' should be spelled out (e.g., ``Figure''
rather than ``Fig.'') wherever they occur.

Papers and notes may use color figures, which are included in the page
limit; the figures must be usable when printed in black and white in
the proceedings.  The paper may be accompanied by a short video figure
up to five minutes in length.  However, the paper should stand on its
own without the video figure, as the video may not be available to
everyone who reads the paper.

\section{Language, Style and Content}

The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consistently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style.
\item Try to avoid long or complex sentence structures.
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms that may be
  unfamiliar to readers.
\item Explain all acronyms the first time they are used in your text---e.g.,
``Digital Signal Processing (DSP)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' may require a local knowledge of English.  Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies and numbers (e.g., ``1-5-97'' or ``5/1/97''
  may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may mean 7:00 am or
  19:00).  For currencies, indicate equivalences---e.g., ``Participants
  were paid 10,000 lire, or roughly \$5.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gendered words (chairman, manpower, man-months). Use
  inclusive language that is gender-neutral (e.g., she or he, they,
  s/he, chair, staff, staff-hours,
  person-years). See~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF} for further advice and
  examples regarding gender and other personal attributes.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Universit{\"a}t,
  Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).  These characters
  are already included in most versions of Times, Helvetica, and Arial
  fonts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the following five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add alternative text to all figures
	\item Mark table headings
	\item Add tags to the PDF
	\item Verify the default language
	\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{enumerate}
Unfortunately good tools do not yet exist to create tagged PDF files from Latex. LaTeX users will need to carry out all of the above steps in the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat, after the PDF has been generated.
 
For more information and links to instructions and resources, please see:
{\url{http://chi2014.acm.org/authors/guide-to-an-accessible-submission}}.

\section{Page Numbering, Headers and Footers}
Your final submission SHOULD NOT contain any footer or header string information 
at the top or bottom of each page. The submissions will be paginated in a determined 
order by the chairs and page numbers added to the pdf during the compiling, 
indexing, and pagination processes.

\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline.  Your PDF file must be ACM DL
Compliant. The requirements for an ACM Compliant PDF are available at:
{\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-distilling-settings.htm}}.

Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 7. This is
widely available at no cost from~\cite{acrobat}.  Note that most
reviewers will use a North American/European version of Acrobat
reader, which cannot handle documents containing non-North American or
non-European fonts (e.g. Asian fonts).  Please therefore do not use
Asian fonts, and verify this by testing with a North American/European
Acrobat reader (obtainable as above). Something as minor as including
a space or punctuation character in a two-byte font can render a file
unreadable.

\section{Blind Review}

For archival submissions, CHI requires a ``blind review.'' To prepare
your submission for blind review, remove author and institutional
identities in the title and header areas of the paper. You may also
need to remove part or all of the Acknowledgments text.  Further
suppression of identity in the body of the paper and references is
left to the authors' discretion. For more details, see the submission
guidelines and checklist for your submission category.

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience.  Please read
previous years' Proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used.  It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., what is the unique contribution that your work
makes to the field?  Please consider what the reader will learn from
your submission, and how they will find your work useful.  If you
write with these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be
successful, both in being accepted into the Conference, and in
influencing the work of our field.
